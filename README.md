# Nuclear-Genetic-Algorithm
Repository for Genetic Algorithm developed by me to optimize new design reactor

ga.py is the code for genetic algorithm, you can run the code for optimization and simulation from this
neutrans.py is the code for neutron transport simulation, you can run the code by creating new input that calls the function from this code or just use ga.py
